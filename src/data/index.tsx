      "It was not even a year since we launched our start up and we were in discussions to raise our seed round. As you can imagine juggling between building an year old start up and the massive documentation, compliances, proofing/modifying the SHA etc is not an easy feat. We had little to no knowledge of the legal requirements before raising any fund. We needed a team to handhold us and at the same time suggest, advice and even fight (a little :)) for negotiations of contracts etc. A friend connected us to MsCorpres Team. We were sceptical to work with a team who is based in another city than someone available in person. The first chat with them made us feel at home and we decided to retain them immediately. The next few months we realised it was the right decision, as the mammoth task of contractual obligations, negotiations required expertise, experience and specially patience which we got from their team. They were available at all times and patiently explained/answered all our queries and accommodated any last minute changes. It also helped that besides legal, they also had secretarial, accounting, auditing teams in their firm. It was a short but intense journey and they helped us through it till the end. Thanks Team MsCorpres for your guidance and assistance. Look forward to working with you again.",
