            <br />
            We will only use your data in a manner that is appropriate considering the basis on which that data was collected, as set out in the table at the top of this policy.
            <br />
            For example, we may use your personal information to:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>a).</b> Reply to enquiries you send to us;
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>b).</b> Where you have specifically agreed to this, send you marketing communications by email relating to our work which we think may be of interest to you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>c).</b> To provide better user experience to visitors/users.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <div className="row">
            <h2>3. When we share your data</h2>
            <br />
            We will only pass your data to third parties in the following circumstances:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>a).</b> You have provided your explicit consent for us to pass data to a third party;
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>b).</b> We are using a third party purely for the purposes of processing data on our behalf and we have in place a data processing agreement with that third party that fulfills our legal obligations in relation to the use of third-party data processors; or
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>c).</b> We are required by law to share your data.

            <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
            <br />
            We take the principles of data minimization and removal seriously and have internal policies in place to ensure that we only ever ask for the minimum amount of data for the associated purpose and delete that data promptly once it is no longer required.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div className="row">
            <h2>Rights you have over your data</h2>
            <br />
            You have a range of rights over your data, which include the following:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>a).</b> Where data processing is based on consent, you may revoke this consent at any time and we will make it as easy as possible for you to do this (for example by putting ‘unsubscribe’ links at the bottom of all our marketing emails).
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>b).</b> You have the right to ask for rectification and/or deletion of your information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>c).</b> You have the right of access to your information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>d).</b> These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your Personal Information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>e).</b> You can assert your rights in the corresponding sections where such information was provided or by contacting us at iot@mscorpres.in.
